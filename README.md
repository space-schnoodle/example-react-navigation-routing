The teacher is going to use in this example the JS library:
[prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types), the library is popular but not so much anymore since Typescript can do more. 

For styling this example will use:  
    [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
    [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)   
    [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)    
    [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
